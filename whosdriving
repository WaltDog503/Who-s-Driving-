    <!-- Author Bio -->
    <h3>About the Author</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Walter. I’ve always considered myself a lifelong learner — curious about how things work, why people do what they do, and how we can all keep moving forward no matter where we’ve come from.</p>
    <p>I’ve been on my own since I was 11, and that experience taught me a lot about resilience and independence. It hasn’t been an easy road, but it’s shaped me into someone who keeps searching for meaning and connection. I don’t have a big circle of friends, and sometimes I find it hard to meet people who are truly kind — but I still believe those people exist, and that kindness is worth looking for.</p>
    <p>I love to play basketball and golf — they both keep me grounded and remind me that growth comes from patience and practice. Lately, I’ve been drawn toward cybersecurity and technology, and I’ve even started a small business called ShakingMyHead LLC. I’m still figuring out what to do with it, but that’s part of the journey. I’m also learning how to code and hoping to build my own website one day.</p>
    <p>Life, for me, has always been about curiosity — about asking questions, learning something new, and never stopping the drive to understand what’s next.</p>

    <!-- Acknowledgements -->
    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    <p>Writing <em>Who’s Driving?</em> has been a journey of reflection, healing, and rediscovery. I want to thank everyone — known and unknown — who has crossed my path and taught me something, whether through kindness, challenge, or even silence.</p>
    <p>To those who believe in the power of change and the possibility of new beginnings, thank you for reminding me that the road is never truly closed — just waiting for another turn.</p>
    <p>I especially want to acknowledge my children — Walter Clinton III, Alexis, Isaac, Isaiah, Aysiah, and Alexander. Each of you has a special place in my heart, and even though life’s paths sometimes take us in different directions, I carry you with me in everything I do. You’ve each shaped who I am in ways that words can’t fully express. My hope is that one day, you’ll see through these pages not just the lessons I’ve learned, but the love and belief I’ve always had in you.</p>
    <p>To everyone who’s ever reminded me to keep driving — whether through faith, friendship, or sheer example — thank you.</p>
    <p>And to the reader: may you always find the courage to take the wheel of your own life, to forgive your past detours, and to drive forward with confidence, purpose, and hope.</p>
